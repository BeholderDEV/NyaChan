# 2 Product's General Description

## 2.1 Overview
In order to promote discussions around specific issues about the concept of internet forums, or messageboard, which through hierarchical and divided topics aimed at giving access to its users a place for social interactions around of common preferences. As an offshoot of the forum's concept, called imageboards were created, which bring as proposed greater emphasis on discussions around images.


Most imageboards has its structure, features and layout baseds on Futaba Channel (also known as 2chan), an imageboard developed in Japan in 2001, which prays for the anonymity of its users and possess strongly divided content by categories, highly dynamic and short, and the content posted by users are typically deleted after a short time according some imageboard rules. 4chan, a popular imageboard based on Futaba Channel, have something about 20 million unique visitors per month, according to the site's creator, Christopher Poole.


By the popularity and potential of the imageboards, and that the most popular imageboards still having a strongly similar layout and style of Futaba Channel, it becomes feasible to improve these concepts in search for a modern approach that could improve the page's UX (user experience).


This project aims to develop a imageboard which has the audience both inexperienced and experienced users of imageboards who wish to participate in discussions around common themes in a modern approach to Futaba Channel. The proposed improvements are primarily based on layout changes, in addition of new features and themes division system by tags, allowing discussions to be categorized in more than one theme.
