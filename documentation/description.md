# 2 Product's General Description

## 2.1 Overview
The concept of internet forum, or messageboard, was created in order to promote discussions around specific topics while promoting a sense of order by dividing the discussions in a hierarchical and well defined sense. The main objective of such places is to attract and promote social interactions around shared interests. As a ramification of the concept of foruns, started apperearing the so called imageboards. which have the purpose of putting more emphasis in discussions around images.


Most imageboards have their structure, features and layout based on Futaba Channel (also known as 2chan), an imageboard developed in 2001, Japan. The fundamental elements associated with Futaba Channel are the anonymity of its users and a content which is well divided by categories, highly dinamic and short-lived according to the rules of the imageboard. 4chan, a popular imageboard based on Futaba Channel, has about 20 million unique visitors per month, according to the site's creator, Christopher Poole.


By the popularity and potential of the imageboards, and that the most popular imageboards still having a strongly similar layout and style of Futaba Channel, it becomes feasible to improve these concepts in search for a modern approach that could improve the page's UX (user experience).


This project aims to develop a imageboard which has the audience both inexperienced and experienced users of imageboards who wish to participate in discussions around common themes in a modern approach to Futaba Channel. The proposed improvements are primarily based on layout changes, in addition of new features and themes division system by tags, allowing discussions to be categorized in more than one theme.
